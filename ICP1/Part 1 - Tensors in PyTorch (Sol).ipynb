PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E6mOjSwdBl8C","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Neural Networks\n","\n","Deep Learning is based on artificial neural networks which have been around in some form since the late 1950s.
